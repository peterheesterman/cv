SUMMARY:
================================================================================
Currently managing a team and loving it. I wrote software for a decade, studied
electronics engineering and math before that and have a habit of thinking deeply
about the world.

I am an eager autodidact, steady leader and an avid collector and sharer of
ideas.

I love hearing from people - please send me a loom!

Curious about business, programming, social justice, game theory, economics, 
language, mathematics, robotics, rock climbing, and psychology.

Victoria University of Wellington (graduated 2015)
  Bachelor of Engineering with Honours (First Class)
  Major: Electronic and Computer Sytems

  Honours Project: Designed and constructed a mesh network node for supporting 
  tele-operated search and rescue robots in mines. These nodes enabled the 
  dynamic construction and repair of a network which allows robots to traverse 
  mine terrain without a tether.

  world Salient Object Detection on a robotic platform” under Associate 
  Professor Will Browne (Nov 2014 - Feb 2015).
